# CSES Solutions

These are what I have so far of the
[CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/). I'm sort of
following William Lin's 12 hour video where he shows just how much of a legend he is, and this is a nice change from LeetCode problems.

I am using C++17, and I include the `bits/stdc++.h` header
because that's what all the cool competitive programmer people
do. 

If you don't have it, you can get it by going
[here](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/precompiled/stdc%2B%2B.h)
to download it, and then just put it in your include directory in
your system path (for MSYS64 C++ installations on Windows like I
have, I had to put it in
`C:\msys64\mingw64\include\c++\11.2.0\bits`)
